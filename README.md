## Design and Implementation

The reasons why I chose this design are:

1. **Personal Affinity:** I love tabletop RPGs, and designing something close to my interests makes it easier to imagine and implement.
2. **Shared Ambition:** I believe your company might share the same enthusiasm for games in general.

The design approach is minimalistic and modern. Despite the time pressure, I am quite happy with the outcome. I hope this resonates with you!

## Expanding the ESLint Configuration

To expand the ESLint configuration, you can modify the `.eslintrc` file to include additional rules and plugins as needed. This will help maintain code quality and consistency across the project.
